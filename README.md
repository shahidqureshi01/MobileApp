This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App]

You have to install the required modules by running following command 

### `npm install`

Alternatively you can achieve the same result if Yarn is install

### `yarn install`

Once finished, you will be able to run the App by following command

### `npm start` 

Alternatively you can achieve the same result if Yarn is install by running following command

### `yarn start` 

The above commands Run your app in development mode and gives you QR code which you can scan on your phone to connect the 
App to your phone. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Note: I had difficult time running this app as the App was picking up my virtual Adopter thus I couldn't establish a connection. It only started working when I disabled the virtual adopter. Please be mindful if you have virtualisation and used Vagrant in the
past.
